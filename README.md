## Welcome to My Data Journey

As a data analyst, I specialize in integrating qualitative observations with quantitative analysis to gain comprehensive insights and drive data-driven decisions.

### My Projects:

[Fitness Hacks for Life Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/FitnessHacksAnalysis)

- Volunteered through Catchafire for Fitness Hacks for Life, a mental health wellness eCommerce platform, to analyze Google Analytics and Google Ads data over a three-month period.
- Collaborated closely with stakeholders to understand why products like the Mind Journal were underperforming in sales, presenting findings through a Tableau dashboard.
- Analyzed key factors such as ad campaign performance, device usage across different regions, and overall website engagement using SQL queries to pull detailed data for visual reporting.
- Identified issues like low visibility in targeted ads and limited regional outreach, recommending strategies to optimize marketing efforts for greater impact.

[TechTrove eCommerce Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/TechTrove_eCommerce_Analysis)
   
- Analyzed more than 100k records of sample eCommerce data using SQL and Excel for a simulated company, TechTrove. Extracted key metrics including average order value, total sales, and order counts. Identified  opportunities to discontinue underperforming items and optimize the loyalty member program to  drive business success relevant to marketing and sales teams.

[Pinnacle Health Insurance Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/PinnacleHealthAnalysis)

- This project analyzed data from Pinnacle Health Insurance as a case study to assess North Star Metricsâ€”Cost Per Click (CPC), Click-Through Rate (CTR), impressions, and clicks in order to evaluate campaign success. Using SQL and Tableau, a 50k row dataset was examined, revealing that some campaigns had low CPC and high CTR, while others either received no clicks or had high CPC. Based on these findings, recommendations were made for Pinnacle Health Insurance to reconfigure their campaigns and health plans, optimizing them to increase profitability and boost financial performance.

[Student Performance Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/Student_Performance_Analysis)

- Analyzed student performance in Portugal. Students within a 15-minute drive of the school performed better, and students who drank during the week had lower grades. Parental employment in healthcare or teaching correlated with higher student achievement (>12.5 on a 20-point scale). Schools can leverage these findings to enhance grades by optimizing transportation and cultivating supportive family and school environments.


### About Me:

- As a data analyst, I leverage my background as an OT to extract meaningful insights from both qualitative and quantitative contexts.
- I excel as a collaborative team player adept at problem solving and skilled in engaging with diverse stakeholders.
- Managed caseloads of over 50 students, adept in goal setting, and proficient in administering standardized assessments to derive actionable insights for individual qualifications.
- Outside of analyzing and creating data-driven visualizations, you can find me running near the bay or cooking dinner with my friends.
