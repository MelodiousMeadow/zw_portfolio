## Greetings World !!

I'm Zoë, a data analyst with a foundation in occupational therapy (OT). My background as an OT has provided me with the expertise to integrate qualitative observations with quantitative data analysis, enabling me to gain thorough insights when evaluating individuals for OT services. I have refined my expertise in applying these skills in data analytics.

### My Projects:

[TechTrove eCommerce Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/TechTrove_eCommerce_Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
   
- Analyzed more than 100k records of sample e-commerce data using SQL and Excel for a simulated company, TechTrove. Extracted key metrics including average order value, total sales, and order counts. Identified  opportunities to discontinue underperforming items and optimize the loyalty member program to  drive business success relevant to marketing and sales teams.

[Pinnacle Health Insurance Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/PinnacleHealthAnalysis)

- This project analyzed data from Pinnacle Health Insurance as a case study to assess North Star Metrics—Cost Per Click (CPC), Click-Through Rate (CTR), impressions, and clicks in order to evaluate campaign success. Using SQL and Tableau, a 50k row dataset was examined, revealing that some campaigns had low CPC and high CTR, while others either received no clicks or had high CPC. Based on these findings, recommendations were made for Pinnacle Health Insurance to reconfigure their campaigns and health plans, optimizing them to increase profitability and boost financial performance.

[Student Performance Analysis](https://github.com/MelodiousMeadow/Student_Performance_Analysis)

- Analyzed student performance in Portugal. Students within a 15-minute drive of the school performed better, and students who drank during the week had lower grades. Parental employment in healthcare or teaching correlated with higher student achievement (>12.5 on a 20-point scale). Schools can leverage these findings to enhance grades by optimizing transportation and cultivating supportive family and school environments.


### About Me:

- As a data analyst, I leverage my background as an OT to extract meaningful insights from both qualitative and quantitative contexts.
- I excel as a collaborative team player adept at problem solving and skilled in engaging with diverse stakeholders.
- Managed caseloads of over 50 students, adept in goal setting, and proficient in administering standardized assessments to derive actionable insights for individual qualifications.
- Outside of analyzing and creating data-driven visualizations, you can find me running near the bay or cooking dinner with my friends.

### Technical Tools (always open to improve and grow):

Excel |  SQL |  BigQuery | Python | Tableau | GitHub
